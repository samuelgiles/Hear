== Hear

Hear is my first Rails application.

== What it does

* Users sign up, make a list of albums
* Users can mark albums as listened to on other peoples lists

The idea is that you would make a list of your top 40 albums, then share your URL with other people, they would then sign in and mark the albums as listened to.
